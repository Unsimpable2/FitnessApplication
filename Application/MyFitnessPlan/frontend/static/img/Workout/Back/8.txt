Single-Arm Dumbbell Row
With a dumbbell on each side of a flat bench, place your right hand and your right knee on the flat bench. With a straight back and your stomach parallel to the weight bench, grasp the left hand side dumbbell with your left hand, palm facing towards you. Exhaling, bring the dumbbell straight up to your chest by bending the elbow back to a 90 degree angle. Inhaling, lower the dumbbell until your arm is straight down and your elbow has only a slight bend. Repete motion.
