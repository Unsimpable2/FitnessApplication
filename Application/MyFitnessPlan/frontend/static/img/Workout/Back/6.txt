Seated Row
Sit on the bench with your knees bent and grasp the cable attachment. It often has a triangle handle, but it may be a bar. Position yourself with your knees slightly bent, so you have to reach to grab the handle with outstretched arms without curling the lower back over. Brace the abdominals. Pull the handle and weight back toward the lower abdomen while trying not to use the momentum of the row too much by moving the torso backward with the arms. Target the middle to upper back by keeping your back straight and squeezing your shoulder blades together as you row, keeping your chest out. Return the handle forward under tension to full stretch, remembering to keep that back straight even though flexed at the hips. Repeat the exercise for the desired number of repetitions.
