Sumo Deadlift
Brace your core and bring your hips toward the bar. Engage your lower back, legs, and glutes so you feel as if your whole body is turned on and your muscles are activated. Turn your quadriceps so your femurs rotate open in your hip sockets, lining up your knees with your feet and toes. Grasp the bar with an overhand or mixed grip and slide your shoulder blades back and down, locking them into place. Pull up on the bar until it comes into contact with the top of the inner circle of the weight plate while simultaneously pressing your legs into the floor. Do not lift the bar off the floor yet. Inhale and drive your legs into the ground while pulling the bar up. Keep your chest high and your hips down. Pull the bar along your legs as close to your body as you can and press through your heels as you push through your legs to raise up. Squeeze your glutes and fully lock out your knees and hips at the top position. Reverse the movement slowly and mindfully, keeping the bar close to your body to avoid injury to your lower back.
