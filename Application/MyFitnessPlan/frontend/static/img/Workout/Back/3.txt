Bent-Over Row
Assume a standing position while holding the bar using a double overhand grip. Hinge forward until your torso is roughly parallel with the floor (or slightly above) and then begin the movement by driving the elbows behind the body while retracting the shoulder blades. Pull the bar towards your belly button until it touches your body and then slowly lower the bar back to the starting position under control.
