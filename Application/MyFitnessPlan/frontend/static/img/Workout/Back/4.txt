Pull-Up 
Start by positioning yourself under the center of a pullup bar. Reach up and grip the bar with both hands, palms facing away from you. Your arms should be extended straight overhead. Wrap your fingers over the bar and your thumb under the bar so that itâ€™s almost touching your fingertips. Make sure your hands are a little more than shoulder-width apart. Press your shoulders down. Bring your shoulder blades toward each other. Lift your feet completely off the floor, crossing your ankles. Lift your chest slightly and pull. Draw your elbows down to your body until your chin is above the bar. As you lower yourself back down, control your release to prevent injury.
