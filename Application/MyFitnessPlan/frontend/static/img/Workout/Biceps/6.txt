Preacher Curl
Grab the barbell or EZ curl bar with an underhand grip, and sit down on the preacher curl bench with your feet flat on the floor. Adjust the seat to allow your upper arms and chest to be in contact with the arm pad. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement. Your arms should be long with a slight bend in your elbows. Maintain a neutral wrist position and a comfortable grip. All repetitions should begin from this position. While keeping your upper arms in contact with the arm pad, initiate the upward movement by squeezing your biceps and bending your elbows. Continue to lift until the barbell or EZ bar is level with your shoulders. Finish the movement by squeezing your biceps. Slowly straighten your elbows to lower the barbell to the starting position.
