Hammer Curl
Stand with your legs straight (but not stiff or locked) and knees aligned under the hips. Your arms are at your side with a dumbbell in each hand, the weights resting next to the outer thigh. Your palms are facing the thighs, the thumbs are facing forward, and shoulders are relaxed. Bend at the elbow, lifting the lower arms to pull the weights toward the shoulders. Your upper arms are stationary, and your wrists align with the forearms. Hold for one second at the top of the movement. Your thumbs will be close to the shoulders and palms facing toward the body's midline. Lower the weights to return to the starting position.
