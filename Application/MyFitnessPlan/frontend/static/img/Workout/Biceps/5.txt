Incline Curl
Adjust the bench so that it’s at a 45-degree angle, or up to 60 degrees as needed. Sit down against the workout bench, keeping your back straight and your abdominal muscles tight. Your weights should be at your sides to start, one in each hand. When you’ve gotten the starting position down, lift each dumbbell, palms up, toward your shoulders. It’s important to keep your upper arms tight so that you can isolate the biceps brachii muscle as you move your lower arms only. Slowly lower the dumbbells back down to your starting position. Don’t release the weights too fast or you could strain your muscles. This should be a controlled movement.
