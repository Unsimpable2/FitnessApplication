Cable Curl
Adjust the machine so the cable is attached at the bottom with the sliding adjustment. The cable metal grip should extend enough to grasp it comfortably in your hands while your arms are outstretched and palms facing up. Stand with your knees slightly bent and feet planted firmly on the floor. Brace your abdominal muscles, straighten your back, and keep your head steady while looking forward. Curl the cable weight upward, toward the chest, while breathing out. Only the forearms move, rising up from the elbow. Hold at the top of the contraction for one second. Lower the forearms to the starting position on an inhale. Stop before the weights return to the stack, keeping the cable under tension.
