Reverse Pec Deck Fly
Sit down on the reverse fly machine facing the weight stack and get the seat in the position that allows you to grab the handles so your hands are in line with your elbows and shoulders. Position the handles so they are as far back towards the weight stack as possible. They should be together on the last setting. Keep your shoulders down, chest up, and torso upright with your chest glued to the pad. Push with the side of your hands and pull your arms back until you feel a contraction in your upper back and rear delt.  mThe end your arms are outstretched at the side of your body and focus on squeezing the rear delts. You can pause and squeeze the targeted muscles here if you like for greater contraction. Slowly return to the starting position and repeat.
