Barbell Overhead Press
Place the barbell on a power rack so it is in front of your shoulders. You should be able to take the bar off of the rack without standing on your tip-toes or bending down too low. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your hips and knees fully extended, but don't lock the knees. Hold the barbell in a front-rack position (resting on the front of your shoulders) with your elbows pointing forward and hands shoulder-width apart. This is your starting position. Tighten your core, squeeze your shoulder blades together, and press the barbell overhead as you exhale. Continue to press until your arms are locked out. This movement should feel like you are pressing your head through the “window” made by your arms. Engage your back muscles and, with control, return the barbell to the front-rack position while inhaling.
