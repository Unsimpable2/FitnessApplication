Front Raise
Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart. Let your arms hang in front of you with the dumbbells in front of the thighs (palms facing the thighs). Your back is straight, your feet are planted flat on the floor, and your abdominal muscles are engaged. Lift the weights upward while inhaling. Your arms are extended, palms facing down, with a slight bend in the elbows to reduce the stress on the joints. Pause briefly when your arms are horizontal to the floor. Lower the dumbbells to the starting position (at the thighs) with a slow and controlled motion while exhaling.
