Seated Dumbbell Shoulder Press
Set up an adjustable angle bench to 90 degrees and select the desired weight from the rack. Pick up the dumbbells from the floor using a neutral grip (palms facing in). Position the end of the dumbbells on your knees and sit down on the bench. Using a safe and controlled motion, kick your knees up one at a time in order to get each dumbbell into place. Once the dumbbells are in place, rotate your palms so they are facing forward. Take a deep breath then press the dumbbells overhead by extending the elbows and contracting the deltoids. Slowly lower the dumbbells back to the starting position (the arms should be roughly 90 degrees or slightly lower depending upon limb lengths).
