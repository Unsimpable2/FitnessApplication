Barbell Upright Row
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Grasp the barbell and allow it to hang in front of you at the length of your arms. Your palms should be facing your body and your hands in line with the thighs. Breathe in and brace the abdominals. Keep your back straight, chest up, and eyes focused forward. Lift the barbell up (toward the chin) as you exhale. Lead with the elbows and keep the bar close to the body. Pause at the top of the lift. Lower the barbell as you inhale, returning it to the starting position.
