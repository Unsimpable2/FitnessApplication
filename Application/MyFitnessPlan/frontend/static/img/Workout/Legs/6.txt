Goblet Squat
Hold the dumbbell vertically, gripping it with both hands underneath the top of the weight. Keep the dumbbell close to your chest throughout the entire movement. Point your knees in the same direction as your toes. Inhale and begin to squat, sitting back in your hips, keeping your core tight and torso upright. Donâ€™t touch your elbows to your knees if it causes you to lose proper form. Drive through your heels back to the starting position. Keep your feet flat on the floor throughout the movement and avoid lifting your heels in an attempt to get your hips lower.
