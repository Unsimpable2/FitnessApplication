Leg Curl
Lie face down on the lying leg curls machine, stretching your legs out fully. The roller pad should rest just above the heels, a few inches over your calves. Grasp the support handles on each side of the machine. Exhale and flex your knees, pulling your ankles as close to your buttocks as possible. Keep your hips firmly on the bench. Hold briefly. Inhale as you return your feet to the starting position in a slow and controlled movement.
