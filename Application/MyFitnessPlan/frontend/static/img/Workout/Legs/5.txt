Dumbbell Split Squat
Set up in a split stance position while gripping dumbbells by your side with a neutral grip. Descend by flexing both knees simultaneously and continue until the back knee touches the ground directly beneath the hip. Drive through the front foot and extend the knee as you return to the starting position. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
