Barbell Front Squat
Start with the barbell in the rack. It should be around the middle of your chest. To assume the front squat grip, place your hands just wider than shoulder-width. This will be approximately a thumb’s length off of the knurling.Step into the bar and slightly bend your knees to get the bar into position on the “meat” of your front shoulders. Think of pushing your elbows as high in front of you as they’ll go. This is where front squat wrist mobility comes into play. Drive up, lifting the bar out of the rack, and take one step backward with the barbell in your front rack position. Place your feet approximately shoulder-width apart. Your toes should be pointed slightly outward.Take a deep breath in and hold it. Bend your legs and send your hips down to lower into a squat. Think of pushing your knees out as you do so. Keep your eyes either straight ahead or slightly up. If you look down, your elbows and torso are going to follow and you’re likelier to cave in. Squat as low as you can while maintaining an upright torso and pushed-out knees.Stand up out of your squat and exhale.
