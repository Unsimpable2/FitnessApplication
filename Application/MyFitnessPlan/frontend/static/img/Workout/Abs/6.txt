Dumbbell Side Bend
Grasp a set of dumbbells. Stand straight up with one dumbbell in each hand, palms facing in. Keep your feet firmly on the floor with a shoulder width stance. Keeping your back straight and your eyes facing forwards, bend down to the right as far as you can, then back up again. Without pausing at the top, bend down to the left. Repeat for desired reps.
