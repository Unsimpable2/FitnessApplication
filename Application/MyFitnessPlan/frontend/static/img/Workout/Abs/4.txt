Bicycle Crunches
Lie flat on an exercise mat with your face up, your legs straight, your feet on the floor, and your head and shoulders slightly raised off the mat. Place both of your hands on the back of your head without interlocking your fingers. Slightly tuck your pelvis and bring your ribcage down. Engage your core. Your spine and pelvis should be in a neutral position. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement. Raise your knees toward your chest until your shins are parallel to the floor. Engage your abs and curl the right side of your upper body off the floor to move your right elbow towards your left knee. Pause for a second while at the end of the movement while squeezing your abs and obliques. The left side of your upper body should remain in place with your right leg straight. Rotate the left side of your upper body to move your left elbow toward your right knee while bringing the right side of your upper body and left leg back toward the floor. Continue to alternate back and forth.
