Dumbbell Crunch
Grab a dumbbell, weight plate, or medicine ball and hold it close to your chest as you lie face-up on an exercise mat with your knees bent and your feet on the floor. Your spine and pelvis should be in a neutral position. Your ribs should be down and your pelvis should be slightly tucked. Engage your core. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement, as if you were holding an egg under your chin. All repetitions should begin from this starting position. Hold the weight close to your chest and begin the upward movement by squeezing your abs. Curl your shoulders off the floor while squeezing your abs. Pause at the top of the movement. Slowly lower to the starting position while maintaining tension on your abs. Repeat for the desired number of repetitions.
