Hanging Leg Raise
Grasp a pull-up bar with your hands shoulder-width apart, using an overhand grip. Engage your abdominal muscles and while keeping your torso stable, slowly raise your legs, keeping them straight and driving through your glutes, until they’re at 90° with your torso. Slowly lower and return to the start position. Take extra care to keep your torso and hips still.
