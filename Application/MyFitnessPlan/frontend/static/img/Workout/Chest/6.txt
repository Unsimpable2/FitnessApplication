Dumbbell Pull-Over
Grab a dumbbell and sit on the bench. Use an overhand grip to hold the dumbbell with both hands. Lie back on the bench. Once in position, push the dumbbell toward the ceiling. The dumbbell should be over your chest. Rotate your shoulders outward to engage your lats. Your upper back should remain tight and stable throughout the entire set. Your arms should be stright with a slight bend in your elbows. Your elbows should be pointed toward your legs. Engage your core and maintain a neutral head and neck position. Your chin should remain tucked throughout the movement, as if you were holding an egg under your chin. All repetitions should begin from this starting position.Begin the downward movement by lowering the dumbbell behind your head. Lower the dumbbell until you feel a stretch in your chest and lats. Pause at the bottom of the movement while maintaining tension in your chest and lats. Begin the upward movement by squeezing your lats to pull the dumbbell back to the starting position.
