Incline Bench Press
Lie flat on an incline bench (30-45Â°) and set your hands just outside of shoulder width. Set your shoulder blades by pinching them together and driving them into the bench. Take a deep breath and remove the barbell from the rack, at the same time maintain tightness through your upper back. Let the weight settle and ensure your upper back remains tight after lift off. Inhale and allow the bar to descend slowly by unlocking the elbows. Lower the bar in a straight line to the base of the sternum (breastbone) and touch the chest. Push the bar back up in a straight line by pressing yourself into the bench, driving your feet into the floor for leg drive, and extending the elbows.
