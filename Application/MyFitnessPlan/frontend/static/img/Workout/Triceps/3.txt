Dumbbell Overhead Triceps Extension
Hold the weight overhead by grasping the inside dumbbell plate surface with both hands, or by grasping both handles of the kettlebell. Slowly bend your elbows and lower the weight behind your head as far as you can. Remember to keep your trunk upright and your core engaged. The weight should follow the path of your spine. Then, at the lowest point, straighten your elbows and extend the weight back overhead. Hold the fully extended position for a moment, then repeat. Keep the movement slow and controlled.
