Skull Crusher
Sit on the bench with the barbell on your lap. Grasp the barbell with a shoulder-width grip, palms facing down, while keeping your wrists straight. Lie on your back as you bring the weight up to a position over your collarbone. Keeping your shoulders stable, slowly bend your elbows, bringing the weight down to just past your head. Keep your elbows pointing straight ahead as you lower the weight. Hold for 1â€“2 seconds. Then straighten your elbows, pushing the weight back to an overhead position. Keep your humerus bone fixed in space throughout the movement.
