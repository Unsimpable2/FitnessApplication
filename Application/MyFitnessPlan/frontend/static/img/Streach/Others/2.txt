Thread The Needle
Start on your hands and knees. Lift your right hand up toward the ceiling with your palm facing away from your body. Lower your arm to bring it under your chest and over to the left side of your body with your palm facing up. Activate your right shoulder and arm to avoid collapsing into this area. Keep your left hand on the floor for support, lift it toward the ceiling, or bring it around to the inside of your right thigh. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds.
