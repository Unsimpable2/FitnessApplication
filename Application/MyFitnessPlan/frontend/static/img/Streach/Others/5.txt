Overhead Reach
Sit or stand tall, your feet planted roughly hip distance apart. Check your posture. Reach both arms directly overhead and clasp your hands together, interlacing your fingers. Take a breath in, and as you exhale, turn your palms forward and then upward so theyâ€™re facing the ceiling. Press higher with your shoulders and wrists, aiming to further extend your wrists until you feel a stretch through your forearms. Hold the position for 30 seconds.
