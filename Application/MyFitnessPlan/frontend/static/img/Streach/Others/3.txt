Reverse Prayer Pose
You can do this pose while seated, standing, or in tree pose. Bring your hands behind your back with the backs of your hands facing each other and your fingers facing down. From here flip your hands in the other direction so your fingers are facing up. Turn your palms to face each other. Press your palms together, draw your elbows slightly back, and open your chest. Keep your spine straight. Hold this pose for 30 seconds.
