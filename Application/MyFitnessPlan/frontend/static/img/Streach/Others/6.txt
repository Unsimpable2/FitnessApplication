Fisted Wrist Flexion
Sit up tall with good posture, your feet planted roughly hip distance apart. Tip forward from your hips, maintaining good posture, and rest your forearms on your thighs, your palms facing up. Make fists with both hands (but donâ€™t squeeze them too tight). Take a breath in. As you exhale, flex your wrists, drawing them upward so your palms face toward you. Hold for two beats of your heart before releasing and returning to the starting position. Perform two sets of 15/20 repetitions.
