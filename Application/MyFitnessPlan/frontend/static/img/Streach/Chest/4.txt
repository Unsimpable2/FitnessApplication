Extended Childâ€™s Pose on Fingertips
Kneel on the floor. Touch your big toes together and sit on your heels; next, separate your knees about as wide as your hips. Bend forward from the hips and walk your hands out as far in front of you as possible. With the arms extended and palms facing down, come up onto the fingertips as if you have a ball underneath your palms and melt the chest toward the floor.
