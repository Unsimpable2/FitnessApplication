Above-the-head Chest Stretch
Seated or standing, interlock your fingers, bend your elbows and raise your arms above your head. Gently squeeze your shoulder blades together and move your elbows and hands backward. Vary the height of your hands to emphasize shoulders and/or chest (hands behind head, hands on top of head, hand a few inches above head).
