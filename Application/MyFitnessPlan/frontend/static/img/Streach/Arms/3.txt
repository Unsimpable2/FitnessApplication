Seated Bicep Stretch
Sit with bent knees and your feet flat on the floor in front of your hips. Place your hands on the floor behind you with your fingers facing away from your body. Evenly distribute your weight between your feet, buttocks, and arms. Slowly scoot your buttocks forward, toward your feet, without moving your hands. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds.
