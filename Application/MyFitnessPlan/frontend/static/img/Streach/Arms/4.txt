Overhead Triceps Stretch
Stand with feet hip-width apart and roll your shoulders down and back (depress and retract the scapulae).  Reach your right arm to the ceiling keeping your shoulder down (away from your ears).  Bending at the elbow, let your right hand drop to the middle of your back, palm facing your back.  Reach your left hand to the ceiling and place your fingers on your right arm, just above the elbow, applying light pressure to deepen the stretch.
