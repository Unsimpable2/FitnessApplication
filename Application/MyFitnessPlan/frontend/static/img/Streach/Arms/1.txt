Wall Bicep Stretch
Stand in a doorway with your left hand grasping the doorway at waist level. Step forward with your left foot, bend your knee, and yield your weight forward. Feel the stretch in your arm and shoulder while maintaining a slight bend in your elbow. Hold this position for up to 30 seconds.
