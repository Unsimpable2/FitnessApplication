Lateral Squat
Stand up and place your feet double shoulder-width apart. Shift your weight to your right leg, bend your right knee, and push your hips back as if youâ€™re going to sit down. Drop as low as possible while keeping your left leg straight. Keep your chest up and your weight on your right leg. Breathe deeply and hold for 10 to 20 seconds before returning to the starting position.
