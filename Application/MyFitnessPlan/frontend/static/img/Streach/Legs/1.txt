Seated Forward Bend
Begin in Staff Pose, sitting on the edge of a folded blanket. Press your heels away from your body; press your palms or finger tips into the floor beside your hips. Inhale. Keeping your front torso long, exhale and lean forward from your hips. Lengthen the spine to fold toward your legs, without rounding your back. Walk your hands out along the outside of each leg as far as they will go. If you can reach them, hold the sides of your feet with your hands. With each inhalation, lift and lengthen your front torso just slightly; with each exhalation, release a little more fully into the forward bend. If you are holding your feet, bend your elbows out to the sides and lift them away from the floor. Stay in the pose from as long as you can. To come up, release your feet. Inhale and lift your torso by pulling your tailbone down and into the pelvis.
