Single-Leg Seated Forward Fold
Begin in a seated position with your legs extended out in front of you with toes flexed. Lengthen your spine to sit up tall and rest your hands on the mat on either side of your hips. This is called Staff. From Staff, release your right leg and place your foot on the inside of your left knee. Use your outer thigh to draw your right knee towards the mat. Allow your spine to round and lower your torso towards your left thigh, ensuring that your shoulders remain level. At the same time, release your hands and place them around the outsides of your left foot. If you cannot reach your foot, place your hands on your knee, shin or wherever is comfortable. This is called Single-Leg Seated Forward Fold. Hold this position for the specified amount of time, continuously breathing in and out through your nose.
