Standing Toe Touch
Stand upright with your feet shoulder width apart, toes facing forward. Keep your legs straight and your knees slightly bent with your arms extended down by your side. This is your starting position. Keeping your body loose, bend forward at the torso and let your fingers hang down toward your toes. Hold for 20 counts and then return to the starting position.
