Cobra Pose Abdominal Stretch
Lie on your belly. Separate your feet and legs to hip width. Point your toes, so the tops of your feet are on the floor. Bend your elbows and place your hands on the floor next to your ribs, stacking your wrist and elbow. On an inhale, begin to peel your chest away from the floor, lifting into spinal extension. When reaching your limit, hold for as much as you can.
